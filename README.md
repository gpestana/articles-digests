### Energy Eﬃciency in Data Warehouses
####A heterogenous hardware approach for high energy physics computing (HEP)


####master's thesis repo

I'm trying to understand to what extent heterogeneous hardware can improve energy efficiency in CMS computing at CERN. In a second phase, I'll try to tackle possible energy consumption hot spots in a more detailed and application level.
