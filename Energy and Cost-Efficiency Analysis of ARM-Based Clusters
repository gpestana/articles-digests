energy efficiency, cost efficiency, ARM cluster, scale-out 
```

what
---
Measurements to understand the difference between clusters using wimpy (ARM-processor) and brawny cores (Intel X86 workstation), taking into consideration energy-efficiency and cost metrics. Three applications were used during the measurements: i) Web server throughput; ii) in-memory database; iii) video trans-coding.
The goal is to " compare the use of embedded processors with the use of general-purpose processors and to understand the performance, energy consumption and cost trade offs"

why
---
- General-purpose computing domain is transferring from scale-up to scale-out (increase number of cores instead of increasing resources of cores).
- Improvements in mobile device's cores regarding energy efficiency (due to battery constraints)
- Answer the question: "Could wimpy mobile processors overtake the general-purpose processors in the future data centers ?"

challenges
---

contributions
---
- For the same task, an ARM cluster is 1.2 to 9.5 times more efficient than a Intel X86 processors solution.
- For advanced power management techniques (like SpeedTest), the linear model does not fit. 
- SpeedTest can achieve better performances under lightweight load;
- ARM cluster based are cheaper than Intel X86 solutions when applications have small computational needs. Computation-intensive applications require more ARM CPUs, making it more expensive (although still better solution);

conclusions
---
- Based on done measurements, ARM clusters are in general more energy-efficient than Intel X86 solutions. The difference of energy-efficiency varies from 1.21 to 9.5.
- Multiple ARM processors are needed to provide comparable performance to an Intel X86 solution.
- The power consumption model in Intel is not linear but step-like. Due to the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling techniques (like SpeedTest)
- ARM clusters are advantageous in computationally lightweight applications. 

notes/ questions
---
- scale-out: scale horizontally by adding more machines to the cluster. 
- scale-up: scale vertically, by increasing the resources of the existent machines.
