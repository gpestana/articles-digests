#slide intro
- in HTC, energy consumption has becoming an issue due to the amount of data to
process. LHC, for example, consumes a lot of energy and it is expected
in the future to increase.
- it is expected that only the CMS experiment will have to increase the amount
of data in 2 to 3 orders of magnitude int he next 15 years.
- this raises important questions regarding energy consumption and its costs
and has to be cope somehow.
- one important way to improve energy efficiency of the system is to
understand how and where is energy consumed in a HTC system.

- in HTC, power consumption has becoming an issue. CMS experiment will increase.. -important to know how and where energy is consumed

#slide plots
- the chip monitors measurements are accounting for power consumed by dram and core. 
- the experiment was performed using different number of threads per core.
- the optimal is ARMv7 with 1 thread per core.
- overcommited: intel the same, arm overcommited and thus got worse
