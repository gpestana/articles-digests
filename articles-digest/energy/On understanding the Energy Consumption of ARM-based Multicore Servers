what
---
Proposal of  trace-driven analytical model for understanding the energy performance of server workloads on ARM Cortex-A9, by modeling the degrees of the CPU core, memory and I/O resource overlap (?), and estimate the number of cores that and clock frequency that optimizes energy performance without compromising execution time.

why
---
Growing interest to replace traditional servers with low power multi-core systems (ARM Cortex-A9, for example), which are usually used in mobile devices (require less I/O and memory resources than servers). Therefore, it is important to assess and study how the lack of resources in this CPUs would be handled in such an environment.

challenges
---
- Low system utilization (when servers are in IDLE mode, not being used in a - estimated - low period); 
- Selecting the optimal number of cores for best relation between performance and system-wide throughput;
- Understand the energy impact of the imbalance (lack of distribution/ proportion) between cores, memory and I/O resources;
- Understand how active number of cores influence the performance and server efficiency.

contributions
---
- Hybrid measurement-analytical approach to characterize energy performance of server workloads of state-of-art low power multi-cores.
- Analysis of execution performance and energy usage for a series of workloads covering high performance computing, web hosting and financial applications.
	- Few types of workloads benefit from executing in large core counts;
	- Their model can predict configuration of the core counts and clock freqs. that reduce energy consumption, without affective execution time.
	- Server workloads can achieve better performance on low-power multi-cores IF performance of memory and I/O is improved.  (to happen with ARM Cortex-15 and ARM Cortex-A50 families) 

conclusions
---
- Workload characterization shows that:
	- burst memory fits a Pareto distribution;
	- non-burst memory traffic can be modeled using exponential distribution;
- Low-power multi-cores may not always deliver the most energy-efficient workloads (due to imbalance between cores, I/O and memory resources)
- Higher memory and I/O bandwidths can improve both execution time and energy-efficiency.
