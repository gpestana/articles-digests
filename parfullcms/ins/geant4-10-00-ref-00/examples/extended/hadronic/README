        Geant4 extended examples - Hadronic processes
        ----------------------------------------------

 Examples in this directory demonstrate specific hadronic physics simulation 
 with histogramming.

Hadr00
------

This example demonstrates a usage of G4PhysListFactory to build 
Physics List and G4HadronicProcessStore to access cross sections.

Hadr01
------

This example application is based on the application IION developed for
simulation of proton or ion beam interaction with a water target. Different 
aspects of beam target interaction are demonstrating in the example including 
longitudinal profile of energy deposition, spectra of secondary  particles,
spectra of particles leaving the target. 

Hadr02
------

This example application is providing simulation of ion beam interaction with different 
targets. Hadronic aspects of beam target interaction are demonstrated in the example 
including longitudinal profile of energy deposition, spectra of secondary  particles,
isotope production spectra. 

Hadr03
------

This example demonstrates how to compute total cross section from the direct evaluation of the 
mean free path ( see below, item Physics), how to identify nuclear reactions, how to plot 
energy spectrum of secondary particles.	

Hadr04
------

This example is focused on neutronHP physics, especially neutron transport, 
including thermal scattering.
See A.R. Garcia, E. Mendoza, D. Cano-Ott presentation at G4 Hadronic group 
meeting (04/2013) and note on G4NeutronHP package

Hadr05
------

This example demonstrates the usage of G4GenericPhysicsList to build 
the concrente physics list at the run time.
