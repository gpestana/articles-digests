 The purpose of this test is to validate the G4IonCoulombScatteringModel
  & G4IonCoulombCrossSection classes. These classes are suitable to simulate
  single Coulomb scattering of protons, alpha particles and heavy ions in all
  target materials form 100 keV/nucleon to 10 TeV. These classes are in
  the PHYSICS list "PhysListEmStandardISS". The default GEOMETRY consists of
  a silicon target (100um x 1cm x 1cm) immerse in the Galactic medium.
  Default PARTICLEGUN has a 10 MeV proton.
  In "StackingAction" the method "DamageEnergy" is implemented in order to
  calculate the fraction of energy which goes into non-ionizing-energy-loss
  (NIEL) of the primary konck-on atom (PKA)

  The OUTPUT statistics is for PRIMARY PARTICLE only.
  At the end of RUN the following information are obtained:

  1) Total track length in absorber.
  2) Mean Number of Steps in absorber.
  3) Mean Free Path in absorber.
  3) Mean Cross Section.
  4) Mean scattering angle.
  5) Total energy deposit in absorber.
  6) Nuclear energy deposit in absorber.
  7) NIEL in absorber.
  8) Total Number of primary knock-on atoms: PKA
  9) Mean Kinetic Energy of PKA
  10)Total Frenkel-pairs Concentration (FP)
