System test for low energy e.m. processes for hadrons, antihadrons and ions

Authors: Vladimir Ivanchenko 

======================================================================

---- Scope
     The ionisation losses of low energy hadrons are sensitive to 
     many details of the simulation code: accuracy of de/dx
     calculation, accuracy of range calculation, accuracy of multiple
     scattering calculation, cuts, steps, and others. This test
     intend to demonstrate that all parts of the simulation of
     electromagnetic physics are working togeather and that results
     are corresponded to the expectations.

---- What it does
     This test build an aplication with simple water
     absorber and the set of Low Energy physics processes.
     The main result of the test is the range and the stragling
     of heavy particles in the absorber. The range can be compeared 
     as with the reference output and with the range data from 
     the ICRU49 report.

---- Description of the input
     3 runs with proton, antiproton and C12 ion incident

---- Description of the output
     Text output

---- Location of the reference output
     test17.out and test17.large_N.out

---- Macros
     test17.in and test17.large_N.in

---- Other files required

---- How to run it
     test17 test17.in >& result.out
     test17 test17.large_N.in >& result.large_N.out
