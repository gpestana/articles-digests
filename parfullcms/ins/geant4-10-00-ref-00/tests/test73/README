Introduction:
------------
This application tests multiple scattering models used in 
different physics lists.
The test is performed executing two consecutives simulations
on two setups: 
   - The first one is composed of 20 thin (0.1mm) Al layers
     separeted by 1um 
   - The second one is composed of 2 thick (1mm) Al layers
     separatd by 19um
Thus the budget material is the same in the cases.
The effect of multiple scattering is compared in the two setups.
Since the material budget is the same, it is expected that the effect is the
same in both cases.

MSC Effect:
----------
Primaries are generated in a position I=(-6mm,0,dz) and fixed moentum.
The momentum direction is such that the primaries have a small Px component
(since Py=,  Pt=Px). dz is chosen such that the primary enters the setup
at (0,0,0) where the first Al layer is located.
The position E and direction P at the exit of the last layer is recorded and
the impact parameter is measured (the impact parameters is the shortest distance
between I and the reconstructed track (back propagating the track from E along
-P). The reconstructed position x component of the impact parameter is expected
to be distributed as a gaussian around 0 with the variance dependent on 1/Pt^2.

Running the application:
-----------------------
The application requires ROOT to perform fit and produce plots
(i.e. root-config should be available in your PATH).

To run the application and perform a Pt scan:

export G4ANALYSIS_USEROOT=1
make
$G4WORKDIR/bin/$G4SYSTEM/MSCTest run_all.mac
root -b -q "macro.C(\"thin\")"
root -l -b -q "macro.C(\"thick\")"
root -l xmacro.C
