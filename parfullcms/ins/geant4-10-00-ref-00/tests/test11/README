                                 Test11
                                 ------

Description:  neutron transport test using Bertini, FTFP and HP (High Precision
              including Thermal Scattering) models.
              The detector is a simple box made up of air, aluminum, lead or
              uranium.

Type of test: run to completion

Building:     This test has a special CMakeLists.txt to be used only by system
              testing.  It will not work when you run the test in stand-alone
              mode.  To do that you must:

              1. copy the test directory from geant4/tests to your working
                 directory

                 cp -r $G4SOURCE/tests/test11 .

              2. replace the existing version of CMakeLists.txt with a
                 stand-alone one:

                 mv CMakeLists.txt CMakeLists.txtorig
                 mv CMakeLists_Standalone.txt CMakeLists.txt

              3. Clean up (if necessary) and re-configure, assuming at least
                 Geant4 version 9.6:

                 cmake .

              4. Build test11:

                 make -f Makefile 
 
Running:      First, generate the input file

                 ./test11_hadronic_exerciser large_N > & test11.largeN.in &

              which sets the number of events per run to 20.  Without the 
              large_N argument there is only one event per run.

              Finally, run the test

                 ./test11 test11.largeN.in >& test11.out &

Output:       run log
