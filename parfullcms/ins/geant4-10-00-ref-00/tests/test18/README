                                   Test18
                                   ------

Description:   generates the nuclei 24Na (ground state), 24Ne, 24F, 24Al,
               24Na (metastable), 46Cr and 215Po, and decays them.  For 215Po
               the nuclear limits are restricted so that daughters are not
               decayed.

               The geometry consists of a solid sphere of aluminum with radius
               250 km, inside of which is placed a solid sphere of quartz (SiO2)
               with radius 125 km.  These reside within a mother volume which is
               a box of vacuum, 1000 km on a side.  All volumes are centered on
               the origin of the coordinate system.  Particles start off from
               the origin with an energy of 1 MeV.

               Beta+, beta-, isomeric transition and alpha decays are tested.
               Along with radioactive decay, standard EM physics processes are
               assigned.  For hadrons the Bertini cascade model is used.  For 
               light ions G4BinaryLightIon is used.

Type of test:  run to completion

Building:      this test has a special CMakeLists.txt to be used only by system
               testing.  It will not work when you run the test in stand-alone
               mode.  To do that you must:

               1. copy the test directory from geant4/tests to your working
                  directory

               2. replace the existing version of CMakeLists.txt with a
                  stand-alone one:

                  cd test18
                  mv CMakeLists.txt CMakeLists.txtorig
                  mv CMakeLists_Standalone.txt CMakeLists.txt

               3. Clean up (if necessary) and re-configure, assuming a 64 bit machine
                  and Geant4 version 9.6:

                  cmake .

              4. Build test18:

                 make -f Makefile 
                 
Running:      To run the short test,

                 ./test18 test18.in >& test18.out &

              This throws one event per run.  For the long test, which throws
              1000 events per run, do 

                 ./test18 test18.large_N.in >& test18.out &

Output:       run log (verbosity 1)
