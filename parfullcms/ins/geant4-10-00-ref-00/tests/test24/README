                            Test24
                            ------

Description:   test of the Binary cascade in a simple setup
               Materials include H, Be, C, Si, Cu, U

Type of test:  run to completion

Building:      This test has a special CMakeLists.txt to be used only by system
               testing.  It will not work when you run the test in stand-alone
               mode.  To do that you must:

               1. copy the test directory from geant4/tests to your working
                  directory

               2. replace the existing version of CMakeLists.txt with a
                  stand-alone one:

                  cd test24
                  mv CMakeLists.txt CMakeLists.txtorig
                  mv CMakeLists_Standalone.txt CMakeLists.txt

               3. Clean up (if necessary) and re-configure, assuming a 64 bit machine
                  and Geant4 version 9.6:

                  cmake .

              4. Build test24:

                 make -f Makefile

Running:      Do

                 ./test24 test24.in >& test24.out &

              This throws 20 events per run.

Output:       run log
