                            Large N running
                            ===============

Examples and tests directories can optionally have input files such as
exampleN02.large_N.in.  Hadronic exercisers take "large_N" as an
argument.

The string "large_N" is used as a key.  The system is extensible, i.e,
one could, in future, add other keys - "Large_N", "LARGE_N" or
"very_large_N".  E.g., one could add exampleN02.Large_N.in or
exampleN02.very_large_N.in

To initiate a large N run:

A) Interactively for run.sh, set environment variable:

     setenv G4LARGE_N <key>  where key="large_N", for example.

B) Remote running using g4allssy.sh, specify, e.g., "large_N" in the action
   field, e.g.:

     sungeant dev1 deb_NONISO geant4-01-00-ref-02-tags3 large_N all all all

   "large_N" will be interpreted as "run" and G4LARGE_N will be set
   to "large_N".

Note: cvs branches "large_N" and "LARGE_N_BRANCH" are no longer used.
For the record, this is how they were made:

echo ../../t*/test[0-9][0-9].in ../../../examples/novice/*/e*.in ../../t*/*exer*cc
cvs update ../../t*/test[0-9][0-9].in ../../../examples/novice/*/e*.in ../../t*/*exer*cc
cvs tag -b LARGE_N_BRANCH ../../t*/test[0-9][0-9].in ../../../examples/novice/*/e*.in ../../t*/*exer*cc
cvs update -r LARGE_N_BRANCH ../../t*/test[0-9][0-9].in ../../../examples/novice/*/e*.in ../../t*/*exer*cc
cvs ci -m 'NEW LARGE N' ../../t*/test[0-9][0-9].in ../../../examples/novice/*/e*.in ../../t*/*exer*cc
