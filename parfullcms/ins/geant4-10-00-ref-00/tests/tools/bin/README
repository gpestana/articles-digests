 setup.csh :
 ---------
  A file that you source to set up the environment.
 It defines also some aliases like :
    g4make
    g4build
    g4tail
    g4filter
 to spawn a reconstruction and analyse log files.

  setup.csh calls specific.csh. This files
 is dedicated for stt members customisation.
 it uses `uname -n` to execute stt specific things.

 build.sh :
 -------- 
  This script spawn the reconstruction of libraries
 from $G4INSTALL/tests/tools/bin directory. The output of the job
 is put in $G4WORKDIR/stt/$G4SYSTEM/gmake.log.
  Aliases g4tail, g4log, defined by the setup.csh(.sh) file
 permits to follow the job, and to filter output.

  Usage :
     UNIX> cd <g4install>/tests/tools/bin
     UNIX> chmod u+x build.sh
     UNIX> ./build.sh all
     UNIX> ./build.sh lib all
     UNIX> ./build.sh lib <category>
     UNIX> ./build.sh test all
     UNIX> ./build.sh test <test>
     UNIX> ./build.sh run
  The last command spawn tests.

 filter.sh :
 ---------
  This script takes a gmake.log file
 produced by a reconstruction. It filters
 this file by removing lines found in 
 file in a specific .filter file.

 Usage :
     UNIX> cd <g4install>/tests/tools/bin
     UNIX> chmod u+x filter.sh
     UNIX> ./filter.sh OSF1
 or :
       csh> cd <g4install>/tests/tools/bin
       csh> source setup.csh
       csh> g4filter

  Then you have to provide a :
       tests/tools/bin/<g4system>.filter
 corresponding to your g4system(s).
 In it you put part of the lines that 
 you don't want to appear in the filtered 
 output. See OSF1.filter and HP-aCC.filter
 output. 


 summary :
 -------
  Then mainly with these files, to reconstruct
 for example the libs and survey without aliases :
   UNIX> cd <g4install>/tests/tools/bin
   UNIX> ./build.sh lib all
   UNIX> tail -f $G4WORKDIR/stt/$G4SYSTEM/gmake.log
   UNIX> ./filter.sh $G4SYSTEM

  In csh with setup file, to spwan reconstruction 
 of lib and tests programs do :
    csh> cd <g4install>/tests/tools/bin
    csh> source setup.csh
    csh> g4build all
 and to survey do :
    csh> g4tail
    csh> g4filter

 SWON...

 g4allsys.sh takes commands or a datafile to build and run tests on all systems.
 
 g4allsys.sh invokes g4sbr.sh via remote shell
      cli is parsed to tokens
             host devprod debopt tag action actarg1 actarg2 actarg3 nonincremental
      for each line giving a host a remote shell is invoked 
          under account stesting to run the script (with full pathname)
          /afs/cern.ch/sw/geant4/stt/$devprod/
           testtools/geant4/tests/tools/bin/g4sbr.sh 
          with the arguments devprod debopt tag action actarg1 actarg2 actarg3 nonincremental
          and appends to an output logfile  $host.$devprod.$debopt.log
      otherwise # indicates a comment
                % indicates a (local) unix command

 g4sbr.sh SetupBuildRun
          Does a few checks on the environment and file systems
          Environment variables are set (or unset) according to the arguments
          G4LARGE_N
          G4DEBUG
          G4STTNONISO
          G4NOHIST
          and then runs (full path) setup.sh
            which defines
            CLHEP_BASE_DIR
            G4STTDIR
            G4WORKDIR
            [finish/restructure]
            G4INSTALL   /afs/cern.ch/sw/geant4/stt/dev1/src/geant4
            G4SYSTEM    Linux-g++
            G4STTDIR    /afs/cern.ch/sw/geant4/stt/dev1/testtools/geant4/tests/tools
            G4WORKDIR   /afs/cern.ch/sw/geant4/stt/dev1/Linux-g++/debug
            G4LIB       /afs/cern.ch/sw/geant4/stt/dev1/Linux-g++/debug/lib
      
          checks some locks
            stt         is a softlink stt.reftag
          makes a new stt.reftag directory (if non-incremental)
          cd's to G4WORKDIR
               sources (oops ${G4INSTALL}/tests/tools/bin/limit.sh)
               source   ${G4STTDIR}/bin/tmpenv.sh
               runs ${G4STTDIR}/bin/build.sh (arg1 arg2) if action build/all
               runs ${G4STTDIR}/bin/run.sh   (arg3)      if action run/all
          waits for completion (how ?)

 setup.csh (blah above ?)
 build.sh 
   cd's to  $G4INSTALL/source and runs gmake -k
   cd's to  $G4INSTALL/tests  and runs gmake -k clean_bin and then gmake -k
