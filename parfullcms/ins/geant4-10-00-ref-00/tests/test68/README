                            ------

Description:    reproducibility tests of FTFP_BERT.
                It does 80 checks of reproducibility for each
                of the following 5 cases of single hadrons
                impinging on a simplified calorimeter:
                  1.  20 GeV  kaon0L  on  Fe-Sci
                  2.  20 GeV  pion-   on  Cu-LAr
                  3.  20 GeV  neutron on  Pb-Sci
                  4.  20 GeV  proton  on  W-LAr
                  5.  20 GeV  kaon-   on  PbWO4

Type of test:   run to completion

Building:       This test has a special CMakeLists.txt to be used only by system
                testing.  It will not work when you run the test in stand-alone
                mode.  To do that you must:

                1. copy the test directory from geant4/tests to your working
                   directory

                2. replace the existing version of CMakeLists.txt with a
                   stand-alone one:

                   mv CMakeLists.txt CMakeLists.txtorig
                   mv CMakeLists_Standalone.txt CMakeLists.txt

                3. Clean up (if necessary) and re-configure, assuming a 64 bit machine
                   and Geant4 version 9.6:

                   rm test68
                   cmake .

                4. Build test68:

                   make -f Makefile 

Running:        Do one of the following, depending on which calorimeter you want

                   reproducibility_k0lFeSci.py
                   reproducibility_kmPbWO4.py
                   reproducibility_nPbSci.py
                   reproducibility_pWLAr.py
                   reproducibility_pimCuLAr.py

Output:         run log
