                    Test 68 History file
                    --------------------
This file should be used by the test developer to briefly
summarize all major modifications introduced in the code and keep
track of all tags.

21-11-13 A. Dotti                         test68-V09-06-09
----------------------------------------------------------
- Use G4RunManager::ReinitializeGeometry() to change
  geometry between runs

17 Jun 2013 Alberto Ribon                 test68-V09-06-08
----------------------------------------------------------
- Disabled temporarily G4MTRunManager until a good solution
  is found to deal with G4MT.

14 Jun 2013 Alberto Ribon                 test68-V09-06-07
----------------------------------------------------------
- Set the number of threads to 1 (instead of 4) otherwise the 
  different threads try to access the same file.

14 Jun 2013 Alberto Ribon                 test68-V09-06-06
----------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed problem of renaming currentEvent.rndm in Windows.

13 June 2013  Dennis Wright
---------------------------------------------------------
- Migrate to multi-threaded:
    added option to use G4MTRunManager and changed from CLHEP::HepRandom
      to G4Random in test68.cc
    created class Tst68ActionInitialization and moved user init method
      there
    added empty method Tst68GeometryConstruction::ConstructSDandField()

- added CMakeLists_Standalone.txt to be used for stand-alone running 
  (developed by Makoto Asai)

- updated README for cmake build

12 Jun 2013 Alberto Ribon                 test68-V09-06-05
----------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed problem of conflicting currentEvent.rndm between the 5 tests.

12 Jun 2013 Alberto Ribon                 test68-V09-06-04
- Split the 5 configurations that are tested for reproducibility
  in 5 independent tests, each with 100 events.

07 Jun 2013 Alberto Ribon                 test68-V09-06-03
- Increased the timeout for the reproducibility test (now 1 hour).

09 Apr 2013 Pere Mato                     test68-V09-06-02
- Increased the timeout for the reproducibility test.

26 Feb 2013 Alberto Ribon                test68-V09-06-01
- Reduced the number of events from 100 to 80 to avoid timeout errors.

10 Jan 2013 Alberto Ribon                test68-V09-06-00
- Increased the time limit to avoid timeout errors.

13 Nov 2012 Alberto Ribon                test68-V09-05-09
- Fixed the massive non-reproducibility in Windows due to use of
  a Unix command (mv) in the script reproducibility.py .

11 Oct 2012 Gabriele Cosmo               test68-V09-05-08
- Explicit inclusion of units and constants headers.

11 Oct 2012 Alberto Ribon                test68-V09-05-07
- Fixed compilation warning in Windows (<ctime>, std::time).

10 Oct 2012 Alberto Ribon                test68-V09-05-06
- Use $<CONFIGURATION> (instead of hardwired "RelWithDebInfo")
  to get the subdirectory where the executable is placed in Windows.

10 Oct 2012 Alberto Ribon                test68-V09-05-05
- Fix bad output format: it could fix the non-reproducibility
  seen in both Mac and Windows.

10 Oct 2012 Alberto Ribon                test68-V09-05-04
- Try to fix the problem on Windows by specifying explicitly the
  path and name of the executable invoked by the Python script.

05 Oct 2012 Alberto Ribon                test68-V09-05-03
- Moved from "Experimental" group to "Nightly" and "Continuous".
  Increased the number of events from 10 to 100.

08 Aug 2012 Alberto Ribon                test68-V09-05-02
- Fixed small mistake.

08 Aug 2012 Alberto Ribon                test68-V09-05-01
- Can be built with CMake and ready for CTest.

08 Aug 2012 Alberto Ribon                test68-V09-05-00
- Created new test for the reproducibility of FTFP_BERT.
  In this first version, only GNUmakefile (no CMake), and the
  tests are steered by a shell script (not working on Windows),
  which calls a Python script (also not working on Windows).
