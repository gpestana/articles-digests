28th May 2013  John Allison (test202-V09-06-02)
- test202.cc: Changed "QGSP_BERT" to "QBBC" (following B1).
  o Note: For vis testing, the physics list is irrelevant, but we need
    to be sure we are not using a deprecated physics list so that we 
    can compile and test safely.
- Tst202DetectorConstruction.cc:
  o Incorporated "Extra_placements" in "Tubes_etc".
  o Added "G4Paraboloid", "G4GenericTrap", "Simple_tessellated",
    "Simple_union".
  o Revamped "Polycone".
  o Brought new volumes, "G4Paraboloid", "G4GenericTrap" (including a
    boolean subtraction), "Simple_tessellated" and "Simple_union", under
    control of /test202/select.
- vis.mac: Took account of changes in Tst202DetectorConstruction.cc.
- CMakeLists.txt: Added run0.mac to files copied to test location.
