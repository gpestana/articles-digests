        --------------------

An idiosyncratic collection of volumes placed here and there.  It
shows up some vis problems and some tracking problems.

// Usage: test202 [macro-file]
// Typically: test202  (executes vis.mac and enters interactive session)
//        or: test202 run0.mac (executes run0.mac, enters interactive session)
//
// Note: Type of session determined by G4UI_USE... macros.  The first
// found is instantiated (see test202.cc code).

A) test202
   This executes vis.mac and enters an interactive session.  It simply
   displays a selection of volumes using OpenGL.

B) test202 runN.mac, where N = 0,1,2,...
   This executes runN.mac and enters an interactive session.  The runN
   macros vary the volume selection and shoot some particles to
   demonstrate some problems.  Consult the comment lines of the
   individual macros for explanations.
