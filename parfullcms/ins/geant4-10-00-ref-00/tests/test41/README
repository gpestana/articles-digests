The purpose of this test is to validate multiple and single Coulomb 
scattering of muons versus MuScat experimental data (D.Attwood et. al.
NIM B251 (2006) 41). Scattering of 172 MeV/c muons on different foils 
is simulated. The results of simulation ASCII file with probabilities 
is created, the bin sizes are the same as in experiment. The macro 
files for ten foils are prepared. Different electromagnetic Physics 
Lists are available.
