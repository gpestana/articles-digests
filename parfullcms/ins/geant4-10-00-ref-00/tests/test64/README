                            Test64
                            ------

Description:    test of BERT and FTFP for nuclear capture at rest.
                BERT is used for pi-, k-, and sigma-.
                FTFP is used for anti_proton, and anti_sigma+.
                The following 9 materials are tested: 
                G4_Be, G4_He, G4_C, G4_Al, G4_Ar, G4_Fe, G4_Cu, G4_W, G4_Pb.

Type of test:   run to completion

Building:       This test has a special CMakeLists.txt to be used only by system
                testing.  It will not work when you run the test in stand-alone
                mode.  To do that you must:

                1. copy the test directory from geant4/tests to your working
                   directory

                2. replace the existing version of CMakeLists.txt with a
                   stand-alone one:

                   mv CMakeLists.txt CMakeLists.txtorig
                   mv CMakeLists_Standalone.txt CMakeLists.txt

                3. Clean up (if necessary) and re-configure, assuming a 64 bit machine
                   and Geant4 version 9.6:

                   rm test64
                   cmake .

                4. Build test64:

                   make -f Makefile 

Running:        To test Bertini,

                   ./test64 bert.in >& bert.out &

                To test FTFP

                   ./test64 ftfp.in >& ftfp.out &

Output:         run log
