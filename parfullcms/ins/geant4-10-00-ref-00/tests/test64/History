                    Test 64 History file
                    --------------------
This file should be used by the test developer to briefly
summarize all major modifications introduced in the code and keep
track of all tags.

25 November 2013  Gunter Folger          test64-V09-06-03
---------------------------------------------------------
- test64.cc : MS VC18 compilation fix.

21 November 2013  Makoto Asai            test64-V09-06-02
---------------------------------------------------------
- test64.cc : roll back to G4RunManager. Initialize() is invoked
  after G4DecayPhysics.ConstructParticle();

13 June 2013  Dennis Wright              test64-V09-06-01
---------------------------------------------------------
- test64.cc : migrated CLHEP::HepRandom to G4Random

13 June 2013  Dennis Wright              test64-V09-06-00
---------------------------------------------------------
- Migrate to multi-threaded:
    added option to use G4MTRunManager in test64.cc
    created class Tst64ActionInitialization and moved user init method
      there
    added empty method Tst64GeometryConstruction::ConstructSDandField()

- added CMakeLists_Standalone.txt to be used for stand-alone running 
  (developed by Makoto Asai)

- updated README for cmake build  

11 Oct 2012 Gabriele Cosmo               test64-V09-05-06
---------------------------------------------------------
- Explicit inclusion of units and constants headers.

11 Oct 2012 Alberto Ribon                test64-V09-05-05
---------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed compilation warning in Windows (<ctime>, std::time).

08 Oct 2012 Alberto Ribon                test64-V09-05-04
- Fixed warning on Windows.

05 Oct 2012 Alberto Ribon                test64-V09-05-03
- Moved from "Experimental" group to "Nightly" and "Continuous".

09 Aug 2012 Alberto Ribon                test64-V09-05-02
- Ready to be proposed for testing, for the first time.

08 Aug 2012 Alberto Ribon                test64-V09-05-01
- Can be built with CMake and ready for CTest.
  However, it creates too many tests, so it needs to be improved.

08 Aug 2012 Alberto Ribon                test64-V09-05-00
- Created a new test for BERT and FTFP nuclear capture at rest.
  In this first version, only GNUmakefile (no CMake), and the
  tests are steered by a shell script (not working on Windows).
