                            ------

Description:  test of Bertini cascade + precompound for p, n
              Bertini and FTF for all other hadrons
              G4BinaryLightIonCascade for d, t, alpha

              A simple geometry setup using materials H, Si, Cu, U

Type of test: run to completion

Building:     This test has a special CMakeLists.txt to be used only by system
              testing.  It will not work when you run the test in stand-alone
              mode.  To do that you must:

              1. copy the test25 directory from geant4/tests to your working
                 directory

              2. replace the existing version of CMakeLists.txt with a
                 stand-alone one:

                 mv CMakeLists.txt CMakeLists.txtorig
                 mv CMakeLists_Standalone.txt CMakeLists.txt

              3. Clean up (if necessary) and re-configure, assuming a 64 bit machine
                 and Geant4 version 9.6:

                 cmake . 

              4. Build test25:

                 make -f Makefile 
 
Running:      Run the test:
  
                 ./test25 test25.in >& test25.out &

Output:       run log
