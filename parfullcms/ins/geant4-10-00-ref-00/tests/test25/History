                    Test 25 History file
                    --------------------
This file should be used by the test developer to briefly
summarize all major modifications introduced in the code and keep
track of all tags.

     ----------------------------------------------------------

19 July 2013  Dennis Wright (test25-V09-06-03)
----------------------------------------------
- test25.in: increase events per run from 1 to 100
- add CMakeLists_Standalone.txt to build test outside of system testing
- README: update for building in cmake
- Tst25PhysicsList.cc: remove all LE (Gheisha) models and replace with
    Bertini, FTFP and BinaryLightIon models
- fission process (including G4LFission model) removed (redundant)

6 June 2013  Michael Kelsey (test25-V09-06-02)
-  Continue MT compatibility migrations, per Gunter.  Add new
   Tst25ActionInitialization to replace runManager->SetUserAction() calls.

5 June 2013  Gunter Folger
-  correct test25.cc to compile in MT mode

4 June 2013  Gunter Folger  (test25-V09-06-01)
-  add needed static_cast in test25.cc

30 May 2013  Michael Kelsey (test25-V09-06-00)
- Migrate test25.cc to MT compatibility (G4MTRunManager)

9th October 2012  Gabriele Cosmo (test25-V09-05-00)
- Explicit inclusion of units and constants headers.

18th March 2010  Gunter Folger (test25-V09-03-00)
- Adapt to new multiple scattering classes.
- Fix mac file for SetCut.

2nd March 2009  Gunter Folger (test25-V09-02-00)
- Fixed warnings on unused variables from gcc 4.3/slc5

6th December 2005  Gabriele Cosmo
- Trivial changes for support of CLHEP-2.0.X series.

21st March 2004  Gabriele Cosmo (test25-V06-00-01)
- Removed -pg compilation option in GNUmakefile which was most probably
  originally introduced and forgotten...
  It was causing profile build to be triggered and, as side effect,
  confusing the output generated with Valgrind !

19th March 2004  Gabriele Cosmo (test25-V06-00-00)
- Fixed definition of materials and values in messenger.
- Made test25.in be the default input script.

16th March 2004  Gabriele Cosmo
- Fixed compilation warnings.
- Replaced usage of NULL with 0.
