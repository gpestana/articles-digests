Report on Errors and Warnings arising from system testing on the
<blink><b>geant4-09-01-ref-09</b></blink> development tag.
Note that there is a new problem, absent from previous reference tag,
for novice example N07.

The use of floating point checking has been extended to all debug builds and, 
by accident also to 32 bit optimised. As consequence crashes due to floating 
point exceptions are now detected on more platforms.   

<h3>Test11 - Neutron transport</h3>
This test crashes for a FloatingPoint exception, which is fixed by latest G4NDL3.13, which was not yet used in testing.


<h3>Test21 - Chips as intra nuclear transport</h3>
On Linux/debug/64 bit, CHIPS runs into a exception:
<pre>
	G4QE::FSI:R=17755.2,S+=0,S-=0,L=1,d=14.7889

On Linux/debug/32 bit, the following CHIPS warning appears:

On Linux/optimsed/ 32bit, the following CHIPS exception occurs:

<h3>test28 - Abrasion/Ablation</h3>  
On Linux/optimized/32 bit
<pre>
	ERROR: 8 - Subscript out of range.
	Command terminated by signal 6
</pre>


<h3>test34 - Shower parameterisation with gflash</h3>
There is a warning on all systems:
<pre>
    Warning : Region <crystals> does not have specific production cuts,
    even though it appears in the current tracking world.
    Default cuts are used for this region.
</pre>

In addition, in in Linux/(32+64) bit/debug, there is a floating point exception:
<pre>
    ERROR: 8 - Subscript out of range.
    Command terminated by signal 6
</pre>
  
<h3>Examples/novice/N07</h3> 
On linux, 64 bit both debug and optimised :

</pre>

On Linux/32bit/optimised there is the same problem, but different numbers.

<h3>examples/advanced/microbeam</h3>
On Linux/optimized/32 bit
<pre>
	WARNING - G4MagIntegratorDriver::AccurateAdvance()
        	  Proposed step is zero; hstep = 0 !
</pre>

<h3>examples/advanced/nanobeam</h3>
On Linux/debug/32 bit, there is a problem most likely due to the way STT runs the test.
<pre>
	Try to read more than 32 lines in matrix file !

	*** G4Exception: Aborting execution ***
</pre>
