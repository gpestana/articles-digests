<P>
The Bonsai system was introduced in June 2000 and is used to track tags and testing.
<br>
Any tag in the CVS repository will create an entry in the bonsai database.
<p>
<li>
There are 6 possible statuses for a tag:</li>

<blockquote>
<li>
<b>Internal </b>- if you do not see your tag reach this state in bonsai database 
please contact the STT team.</li>

<li>
<b>Proposed for Testing </b>- You may request a transition from Internal to 
Proposed for Testing (or this may be performed by the STT, if notified to do so).
A comprehensive description of the proposed tag should be entered, specifying
possible co-working tags, if any.
This is essentially a queue of work for the STT team, however it may be appropriate
to revert to this state if one, but not all, of a set of co-working tags are
rejected.
</li>

<li>
<b>Selected for Testing </b>- The tag is being tested.
The tag has been selected for testing and will contribute
to an sdb file extracted from the Bonsai database. 
There are three directories (prod,dev1 and dev2) in which testing may take place.
</li>

<li>
<b>Tag Accepted </b>- the tag has passed the STT procedures and no further action 
from the author is required. The tag should be included in the next reference tag.
</li>

<li>
<b>Tag Rejected </b>- the tag has failed the STT procedures. This may happen if the 
code (on one of the supported platform compilers) fails to compile, or causes failures
in compilation of the base code, or unacceptable results are produced when executing 
the test program suite.
The STT team may contact the submitter with further information by mail.
</li>

<li>
<b>Global </b>- the tag is a global reference tag and should conform to Geant4 
naming conventions. Only the release manager is allowed to issue this selection.
</li>
