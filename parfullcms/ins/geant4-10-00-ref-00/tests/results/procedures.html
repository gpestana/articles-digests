<h1> System Test Procedures</h1>

</p><h1>Introduction</h1>

The testing of Geant4 is using the nightly build system running at CERN/SFT. 
An introduction to this system is given e.g. in 
<a href="http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cnl/39608%22">this CNL article by S.Roiser</a>, 
or in GEANT 4 NIGHTLY BUILDS SYSTEM, 
Victor Diez et.al., <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/1742-6596/219/4/042038/">
J. Phys.: Conf. Ser. 219 042038</a>.

<br>
<br>
Testing is run an several machines in parallel, to test on different
systems, on different hardware, using different compilers, and to
distribute the load. The architecture is a client-server model, with
clients starting a test script via cron or a similar system tool. The
testing script then queries a server for a setup or configuration which
needs to be tested by providing information about its capabilities. For
example, the client could tell "I am slc5 on 64 bit hardware, with gcc
4.3 and gcc-4.1".
The server then provides a specific configuration out of the all of
configurations, see below for details of a configuration.&nbsp; <br>
The scripts then check out the source code of geant4, using the svn
repository based upon the configuration to be tested, for example using
accepted and selected tags on top of the reference tag, or a candiate
reference tag. The configuration of the build and test environment is
obtained from a CMT requirements file. The code is compiled using teh
normal Geant4 build system, and tests and examples are tested using teh
QMtest tool.<br>
Results from compilation and testing are copied to afs and become
available in a web browser. Summaries are also stored in a database.<br>
<br>
a configuration 
is a combination of OS/hardware/compiler and slot. A slot defines the software 
configuration of teh software tested. In Geant4 we normally use two slots, 
one for testing ongoing development, and one to test tags prior to a reference tag 
or release.

  
Basically, every night a testing run is started, and results are reported on a 
<a href="http://lcgapp.cern.ch/spi/cgi-bin/nightly.py?view=slots&amp;slots=17-18&amp;tag=None&amp;dates=week&amp;hiddenSlots=19-16-14-13-22-21-20-23&amp;hiddenTags=58-60-61-41-23-25-35-48-64-50-55&amp;hiddenPlatforms=&amp;slotOrder=58-60-61-41-23-25-35-48-64-50-55">
web page</a>.
A testing run for a given platform, i.e. OS/compiler combination, contains both a 
build using optimized and debug mode. The platforms are specified in a configuration
file, /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/app/nightlies/scripts/configuration_geant4.xml. For Geant4,
we usually test two configurations, one testing tags as these are proposed, 
called tags_bonsai, 
the second configuration is used to test globals tags prior to release.

Testing itsself is local to testing machines, only log files are kept in afs, and
are made available on a 
<a href="http://lcgapp.cern.ch/spi/cgi-bin/nightly.py?view=slots&amp;slots=17-18&amp;tag=None&amp;dates=week&amp;hiddenSlots=19-16-14-13-22-21-20-23&amp;hiddenTags=58-60-61-41-23-25-35-48-64-50-55&amp;hiddenPlatforms=&amp;slotOrder=58-60-61-41-23-25-35-48-64-50-55">

<h3>Definitions</h3>
A <span style="font-weight: bold;">configuration</span> is a
combination of Operating system, type of hardware (32 or 64 bit), and
compiler name and version, and includes the Geant4 configration to be
tested.&nbsp; We regularily test proposed tags in the slot geant4 using
the pseudo tag name geant4-dev. The platforms are specified in a
configuration file <span style="font-family: monospace;">configuration_geant4.xml </span> in the directory <span style="font-family: monospace;">/afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/app/nightlies/scripts/</span>.<br>
<br>
A <span style="font-weight: bold;">testing slot</span> defines the
software configuration of the software tested. The configuration file
defines one which OS/hardware/compiler combinations will tested in a
given slot.<br>
<br>
A <span style="font-weight: bold;">QMtest test case</span> is the
running of a test or example with a specific input; this implies that
the same executable run with different input are distinct tests. We
also made the build of the test or example a QMtest.<br>
<br>
<h1><span style="font-weight: bold;">Testing Procedure</span></h1>
<h3>Testing proposed tags</h3>
Testing fo proposed tags proceeds in interations of selecting tags, checking results, accepting, rejecting or postponing tags.<br>
<br>
<h3>Selecting Tags</h3>
Tags are selected from proposed tags using the full interface to the <a href="https://sftweb.cern.ch/geant4/geant4tagsadmin" target="_blank">Geant4 Tags system</a>.
At the bottom of the window you can select tags by their status, for
selecting tags it is useful to choose mark only "proposed tags", filter
the list of tags. From the set of proposed tags select all the tags you
want to test by marking these, and then click on the "Change status"
button. If depencies for co-working tags are given in the comment
field, be sure to take all of co-working tags together. All tags
getting the status changed&nbsp; are groupped into a tag list, creating
a new taglist is the default. If you want to add a tag to an existing
taglist,&nbsp; you can do this by selecting the tag, click "Change
status", and then tick the box add to tagslist choosing the last one.
Tags should not be added to an existing taglist once a taglist has be
tested in the nightlies, in this case create a new taglist.<br>
<br>
If there are many tags proposed, it&nbsp; usually is safe to select
tests or exmaples for testing.&nbsp; Several tags in related categories
is more challanging, in case tests fail&nbsp; it will be more difficult
to identify the culprit.<br>
<br>
<h3>Checking Results</h3>
Results of testing are shown on the <a href="http://lcgapp.cern.ch/spi/cgi-bin/nightly.py?permalink=1&amp;openSlots=21-22-18-38-17-24&amp;tag=&amp;dates=2011-04-07_2011-04-13&amp;slotGroup=2&amp;visibleCompilers=1-2-3-4&amp;visibleOsystems=1-2-3&amp;visibleArchitectures=1-2&amp;visibleModes=1-2-3&amp;slotOrder=days&amp;scrollElement=slot&amp;orderingCriteria=5268" target="_blank">nightlies page</a>;
this should show only Geant4 related results, but you may tailor the
display using the customisation options on this page. With the current
configuration_geant4.xml, proposed tags are tested in the slot geant4
using the tag g4tags-dev. We have a small number of tests failing on
nearly all platforms, but this number <span style="text-decoration: underline;">must not</span>
increase. To check the log file of a given platform, click in the field
showing the number of failures. You can also get an overview of all
failing tests by clicking on the blue magnifier symbol in the date
area. To reorder the platforms use the arrows in the platform box. In
general nearly everything in this page is a link, and you need to
experiment a bit.<br>
<h3>Accepting, rejecting, or postponing tags</h3>
In general most tags get accepted. You must not accept tags, if there
is a compilation warning, or worse an error, with the code of the tag,
or if there are tests failing newly. If a test previously ok is
failing, the tag causing this must be identified and rejected. It is
recommended to not accept reminder of tags under testing, unless a new
testing run has shown sucess again.<br>
To accept tags, you can either select the tags you want to accept using
the select box, and then click teh "Chaneg status" button. A faster
method is to choose at&nbsp; the top left the tab taglist,&nbsp; then
to choose the correct, in general the latest, taglist, and select&nbsp;
all tags using the select box in the header row, and the click the
"Change status" button, and select the accept box before confirming the
change. <br>
<br>
Rejecting tags is similar to accepting, execpt that you would select
the reject box, and then fill in some description why the tag is
rejected,&nbsp; before confirming the change. A mail with this
description&nbsp; is sent to the person who has submitted the tag, but
if you want to give more detail, please send this more detailed
information in a separate mail, where you also can CC for example the
working group coordinator.<br>
<br>
If a rejected tag is part of a set of co-working tags, you cannot leave
the dependant tags in testing until a fix for the rejected tag is
available. In this case, change teh status of the dependant tags to
"postponed". When the fix for the rejected tag(s) becomes available,
teh postponed tags can be selected again.<br>

<br>
<h1>Large N Tests</h1>
Every Sunday we use a special set of tags, using a different QMTest
configuration file to test a subset of all test cases, but using higher
statistics.<br>
<br>
<h1>Making a Global (geant4-wide) Reference Tag</h1>

Make sure <b><tt>src/geant/tests</tt></b> is up to date.&nbsp; In <b><tt>src/geant4/</tt></b>
of the relevant test area, <b><tt>cvs tag &lt;tag-name&gt; &gt;&amp; cvs_log_&lt;tag-name&gt;.log
&amp;</tt></b>, where <b><tt>&lt;tag-name&gt;</tt></b> is <b><tt>geant4-xx-yy-ref-zz</tt></b>,
where <b><tt>xx-yy</tt></b> refer to the most recent past Geant4 release
and <b><tt>zz</tt></b> is a serial number.
<p>Announce on the Tags Blackboard and invite category coordinators to
add further information.
</p>
<h1>
Candidate Tags</h1>

These are simply global tags used internally by the STT to define a version
of geant4 which has not yet been tested.&nbsp; The format is <b><tt>geant4-xx-yy-cand-zz</tt></b>,
where <b><tt>zz</tt></b> refers to the next global reference tag.
