 
 Test22 is aimed for testing of FTF model and for a comparison
 of FTF results with corresponding experimental data.
 
 Data, input (kind of "macro") files, ROOT macros, and shell scripts
 are not in this directory, but in: verification/hadronic/test22 .

 Contents of  subdirectories "src" and "include" are based on test30.

 Other subdirectories contain codes for defined reactions. 
 The name of subdirectory shows reaction information stored in it.
 For example:

 -  Subdirectory ChipsX allows to calculate Chips total and elastic
    cross sections. 
    Data, input files, ROOT macros, and shell scripts are kept in the
    corresponding subdirectory of verification:
      verification/hadronic/test22/ChipsX

 -  Subdirectory KmPchan allows one to calculate K- Proton interaction 
    channel cross sections using FTF model.
    Data, input files, ROOT macros, and shell scripts are kept in the
    corresponding subdirectory of verification:
      verification/hadronic/test22/KmPchan
