                    Test 69 History file
                    --------------------
This file should be used by the test developer to briefly
summarize all major modifications introduced in the code and keep
track of all tags.

12 November 2013, Davide Mancusi (test69-V09-06-10)
- Remove the quick-and-dirty fix for Windows crash, the problem (?) was in
  G4INCLXXInterfaceStore.

12 November 2013, Davide Mancusi (test69-V09-06-09)
- Quick-and-dirty fix for Windows crash.

7 November 2013, Davide Mancusi (test69-V09-06-08)
- Limit number of threads for HP-based tests.

6 November 2013, Davide Mancusi (test69-V09-06-07)
- Fix the path to the macro for the INCLXX/ABLA test

6 November 2013, Davide Mancusi (test69-V09-06-06)
- Activate the INCLXX/ABLA test.

6 November 2013, Davide Mancusi (test69-V09-06-05)
- Shorten tests with NeutronHP-based physics lists.
- Add a test for INCLXX/ABLA.

6 November 2013, Davide Mancusi (test69-V09-06-04)
- Nothing new, just resubmit the tag.

6 November 2013, Davide Mancusi (test69-V09-06-03)
- Overhaul of test69.
- Add "mix" material, which should help with exercising different sectors of
  the physics list.
- Reduce the number of test cases to 2:
  o 40-GeV p + mix
  o 12-GeV C12 + mix
- Add the possibility to test different physics lists via an envvar.
- Define unit tests for all the INCLXX-based physics lists.
- Add visualisation and UIExecutive in interactive mode.

21 May 2013, Davide Mancusi (test69-V09-06-01,test69-V09-06-02)
- Fix: test69 was actually NOT testing the reactions due to particles being
  prematurely killed.
- Add definition for Li detector material.
- Revise macros.

13 May 2013, Davide Mancusi (test69-V09-06-00)
- Migration to MT.
- Suppress unused user stepping action.

11 October 2012, Gabriele Cosmo (test69-V09-05-02)
- Explicit inclusion of units and constants headers.

14 September 2012, Davide Mancusi (test69-V09-05-01)
- Move all macro files in a dedicated directory.

14 September 2012, Davide Mancusi (test69-V09-05-00)
- Split big test69 into many small tests, so that it can be run in parallel.
- Updated README.

26 October 2011, Pekka Kaitaniemi (test69-V09-04-00)
- Created a new test for INCL++ cascade model.
- Requires INCL++ tag hadr-inclxx-V09-04-03 or later.
