     =========================================================
     Geant4 - an Object-Oriented Toolkit for Simulation in HEP
     =========================================================

                            Test201
                            -------

  The purpose of this test is to test the visualization and 
 graphical user interfaces.


 Executing test201 :
 -----------------
  In order to get correct test201.g4m, etc... files,
 the test should be started in the subdirectory corresponding 
 to the GUI choosed. For example :
 - G4UIterminal, G4UIXm, G4UIWin32, G4UIXaw, start test from 
   basic subdirectory.

  Examples ; for G4UIXm :

   UNIX> cd $G4INSTALL/tests/tools/bin
   UNIX> edit the specific.csh file for your environment.
    csh> source setup.csh
   ( sh> . ./setup.sh)
    csh> setenv XENVIRONMENT $G4INSTALL/tests/test201/test201.xrm
   ( sh> XENVIRONMENT=$G4INSTALL/tests/test201/test201.xrm;export XENVIRONMENT)
   UNIX> cd $G4INSTALL/tests/test201/basic
   UNIX> $G4WORKDIR/bin/$G4SYSTEM/test201 Xm

  The upper assume that Geant4 libraries has been reconstructed
 with the correct :
     G4UI_BUILD_<session>_SESSION
     G4VIS_BUILD_<driver>_DRIVER
 and test201 has been reconstructed with the correct :
     G4UI_USE_<session>
     G4VIS_USE_<driver>
 CPP flags.

 Example of a session with Inventor :
 ----------------------------------
  If executed from basic, test201 offer a menu bar
 (described in test201.g4m), then :
  - Click 'Test/Detector 4' to define a simple geometry.
  - Click 'Test/init' to initialize Geant4.
  - 'Vis/Create scene' to create a scene that have
    the geometry, trajectories and hits (see scene.g4m).
  - 'Vis/OIWIN32' to create an Inventor viewer.
  - 'Vis/notify' to update the viewer. The
    detector must appears (a cube representing the mother
    volume).
    . In picking mode (click in the up arrow icon) :
      * Ctrl/pick (the cube) goes down the next level of geometry :
        you should be able to see some cubes and a cylinder.
      * Shift/pick display the mother volume.
    . In viewing mode (click in the hand icon) 
      * Move left button : rotate.
      * Ctrl move left button : pane.
      * Ctrl+Shift+move left button : zoom in/out.
      * Right button : popup menu. 
  - 'Test/Set gun' to setup the gun particle, energy (it executes
    the gun.g4m file).
  - 'Test/Run beom one' to shoot an event. Some tracks
    should be visible under the cube near the cylinder.
    Use the zoom out to see them. With the popup menu
    setup the wire-frame drawing to see an electromagnetic
    shower inside the cube.
  - Click again in the 'Test/Run beam on' to see more events.
