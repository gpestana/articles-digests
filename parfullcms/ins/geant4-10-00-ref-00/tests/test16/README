                                     Test16
                                     ------

Description:  test of n and p cross sections in the classes
              G4NeutronInelasticCrossSection and G4ProtonInelasticCrossSection.
              All electromagnetic, hadronic and decay processes are included.
              For hadrons other than n and p, the default cross sections are
              used.
 
              Detector is a simple box of air, aluminum or lead.

Usage:        auto-generated file provides input for neutron and proton runs 
              with incident energies of 1, 10 and 20 GeV for each material.
              18 runs in all, with the 10 events per run.  

              Verbose atepping action available but not currently 
              used.

Building:     This test has a special CMakeLists.txt to be used only by system
              testing.  It will not work when you run the test in stand-alone
              mode.  To do that you must:

              1. copy the test directory from geant4/tests to your working
                 directory

                 cp -r $G4SOURCE/tests/test16 .

              2. replace the existing version of CMakeLists.txt with a
                 stand-alone one:

                 cd test16
                 mv CMakeLists.txt CMakeLists.txtorig
                 mv CMakeLists_Standalone.txt CMakeLists.txt

              3. Clean up (if necessary) and re-configure, assuming at least
                 Geant4 version 9.6:

                 cmake .

              4. Build both test16 and test16_hadronic_exerciser:

                 make -f Makefile 
                 
Running:      First generate the input file:

                 ./test16_hadronic_exerciser >& test16.in &

              Finally, run the test:
  
                 ./test16 test16.in >& test16.out &
 

Type of test: run to completion


Output:       run log
