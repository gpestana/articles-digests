Simulation of simplified combined calorimeter. Crystal electromagnetic (ECAL) 
calorimeter and sampling hadronic calorimeter (HCAL) are built. 

Geometry options:
       - ECAL may be not constructed;
       - preshower may be constructed consisting of thin layers
         of all materials from Geant4 material DB.

Analysis is done only using ROOT histograms for energy deposition in 
ECAL and HCAL, transfer shape in ECAL, total calorimeter response.
