                    Test 33 History file
                    --------------------
This file should be used by the test developer to briefly
summarize all major modifications introduced in the code and keep
track of all tags.

     ----------------------------------------------------------

November 28th, 2013 A. Howard  - test33-V09-06-09
- Reproposing tag to test with co-working tag in process/biasing:
  procbiasing-V09-06-16

November 28th, 2013 A. Howard  - test33-V09-06-08
- Rectified issues with delete and clear for multiple configurations with
  new singleton biasing store framework. Put back multiple configurations
  SamplingChange.mac (from SamplingChange_long.mac).

November 27th, 2013 A. Howard  - test33-V09-06-07
- Moved to concrete samplers and included AddProcess() for MT build
  (still with sequential RunManager)

November 27th, 2013 A. Howard  - test33-V09-06-06
- Added missing header to Tst33IStoreBuilder.hh

November 27th, 2013 A. Howard  - test33-V09-06-05
- Reduced to one configuration whilst trying to figure out singleton issues
  with G4IStore (moved multiple configurations to SamplingChange_long.mac)

November 22nd, 2013 A. Howard  - test33-V09-06-04
- Migrated to new IStore and WeightWindowStore singleton instantiation
  (required for MT interface compliance)

November 7th, 2013 A. Ribon  - test33-V09-06-03
- Added forgotten final-state method for neutron capture process.

November 7th, 2013 A. Ribon  - test33-V09-06-02
- Removed LEP and HEP models.

July 29th, 2013 A. Howard  - test33-V09-06-01
- Removed unused variable FieldName from Tst33RunAction.

December 17th, 2012 A. Howard  - test33-V09-06-00
- Removed obsolete G4CellScorer class references.

October 9th, 2012 G. Cosmo  - test33-V09-05-01
- Explicit inclusion of units and constants headers.

January 10th, 2012 P. Mato - test33-V09-05-00
- Fixed uninitialized member variable resposible of the test failure
  on Windows.

November 16th, 2011 G.Folger - test33-V09-04-00
- Migrated to new G4Exception.

March 25th, 2010 G.Cosmo - test33-V09-03-00
- Migrated physics list to use particle-based multiple-scattering processes.

April 21st, 2008 A.Howard - test33-V09-01-00
  - Fixed implementation of parallel geometry (previously it was over-laid with
    the mass world, hence not parallel at all, just grossly over-lapping).
  - Increased importance sampling geometry to be coincident with world volume -
    this removes the warning from the process as the weight doesn't change
  - Removed scaling factors (see Dec 15th, 2005 below)
  - Added MassGeo_TimedApp_new.out and ParallelGeo_TimedApp_new.out for output
    comparison purposes
  - CoupledTransportation can be forced to be used with the MassGeometry:
    MassGeo_TimedApp_coupled.mac (and output is MassGeo_TimedApp_coupled.out)
  - co-working with procbiasing-V09-01-01

Jun 25th, 2007 A.Howard - test33-V08-03-02
  - Added missing sstream header in Tst33SlobedConcreteShield.cc

Jun 22nd, 2007 A.Howard - test33-V08-03-01
  - Migrated to new scoring biasing scheme

Jun 22nd, 2007 A.Howard - test33-V08-03-00
  - Changed class names in Tst33AppStart.hh to be compatible with old
    biasing/transportation/scoring scheme

Nov 22nd, 2006 G.Cosmo - test33-V08-01-00
  - Removed obsolete vis-manager classes. Now using G4VisExecutive.

Dec 15th, 2005 A.Howard
  - Introduced scaling factor to increase physical volume and suppress 
    warnings due to importance sampling from particles crossing world volume.
    Currently set to x2.

Dec 6th, 2005 G.Cosmo
  - Trivial changes for support of CLHEP-2.0.X series.

Aug 19th, 2003 M.Dressel - test33-V05-02-00
  - test for weight window technique

Apr  9th, 2003 M.Dressel - test33-V05-00-03
  - use geometries with a deeper structure to test the parallel
    transport and the G4IStore in a more challenging way

Mar 12, 2003 J.Allison - test33-V05-00-02

  - remove src/G4Trajectory.cc and added a DrawTrajectory function
    in Tst33VisEventAction
  - some changes dut to gcc-3.2 complains.

Nov 25th, 2002 M.Dressel - test33-V04-01-03
  - added src/G4Trajectory.cc.

Nov 23th, 2002 M.Dressel 
  - change of parallel geometry 

Nov 22th, 2002 M.Dressel 
  - changed geometry for scoring. Cells must not coinside with
    wolrd boundary since tracks would be killed before
    scoring is called in the case a track exits a cell into
    "out of world".

Nov, 20th 2002 M.Dressel - test33-V04-01-02
  - some code cleanup
  - added some comments to the header files
  - removed some old files

Nov, 4th 2002 M.Dressel - test33-V04-01-01
