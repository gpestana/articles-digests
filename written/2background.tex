% mining questions about software energy consumption


\textbf{on importance of energy consumption for engineers and scientists}
\\
The study conducted by \cite{QUESTIONS_ENERGY}, shows that engineers have been
considering energy consumption as an important factor when developing software.
It consists on an empirical study that aims to understand the opinions and
problems of software developers about energy efficiency. The data that sustain
the conclusions are  mined from
a well-known technical forum (\textit{StackOverflow} \cite{STACKOVERFLOW}).
Although the study is focused in an application-level energy efficiency, it
shows that developers are aware of the importance of energy efficiency in 
computational systems. When trying to understand in depth what questions arise 
more frequently, it is shown that measurement techniques is amongst the most
asked questions by developers. In addition, the study ascertains that the 
\textit{"lack of tool support"} is an important handicap for the development of 
energy efficient software.
