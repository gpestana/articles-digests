\section{Energy consumption awareness in Scientific Computing}


- current state of HPC systems and energy efficiency (p10)


%TODO: perhaps add more paper references here?
Power consumption and energy efficiency have become a paramount research topic in 
computer science, for energy has become a major growth bottleneck in several systems. 
Moreover, the increasing concerns with energy consumption and its social, economical 
and environmental impact in our society has given a bigger dimension to the discussion.
Given its importance, many research studies have looked into energy efficiency
and power consumption. There is a vast panoply of studies with different
approaches toward improving energy efficiency. For example, to use GPU for data
processing \cite{GPU}, \cite{GREENGPU} or improve energy efficiency by using
RISC architectures \cite{AALTO_ARM} \cite{ACAT13ARM},
\cite{ACAT14ARMDAVID}, . Several other directions have been taken
toward energy efficient computing \cite{QUESTIONS_ENERGY} \cite{GREENING},
\cite{ENERGY_DILEMMA} and the number of related works keeps growing.
 
Scientific computing is often characterized by requiring enormous data storage
capacity, high processing capabilities and complex configuration
\cite{SCICOMPUTING_REQS}. High processing capabilities and massive data storage
are requirements that potentially require massive amounts of energy. Thus, the scientific 
computing community is looking into energy efficiency with special interest.


\section{The European Organization for Nuclear Research and the LHC}

The European Research for Nuclear Research (CERN) \cite{CERN} is a particle physics
research laboratory sited in the Franco-Swiss border where thousands of
engineers and physicists from about 21 state members conduct researches about the
fundamental structures of the Universe. In order to perform experiments that
support the researcher\'s studies, they have built several particle accelerators and detectors.
The most outstanding collider is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The LHC
consists of a 27-kilometer ring of superconducting magnets that boost the
particles while traveling through it. The particles are accelerated in two
beams, traveling inside the LHC in opposite directions. When the beams are
traveling close to the speed of light, they are made to collide in the different
colliders. After each collision, particles and subatomic particles are projected
due to the collision, which is tracked and recorded by the colliders. The data
acquired from the collisions is then filtered and the most interesting
information is stored in the CERN\'s datacenters for posterior reconstruction
and processing. Given the frequency of the collisions and the massive amount of
data to store and process from each collision, the LHC is an example of a scientific
computing endeavor which energy resources are critical to manage efficiently.  

According to  \cite{ACAT13ARM}, the computing requirements for HPC have increased 
particularly in recent years. Most notably, a project with the magnitude and complexity of the 
LHC is a sound example of it. To achieve results like the discovery of
the Higgs boson \cite{HIGGS1} \cite{HIGGS2} and other significant scientific
advances, a massive amount of computational resources - and thus energy - was
necessary. Given the enormous amount of resources needed for storing and
processing the data, it was not viable to concentrate all the tasks in one
single super-node. Thus, the solution was to distribute the processing tasks across 
several partners and institutions through a distributed network of nodes, called
the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG). The WLCG \cite{WLCG} is a grid
computing platform where more than 170 computing centers spread across 40
countries \cite{WLCG} collaborate to store and process the data coming from the
LHC experiment. According to \cite{WLCG}, the WLCG alone is responsible for the distribution, 
storage and processing of more than 30 Petabytes annually. According to
\cite{ACAT13ARM}, the equivalent capacity of WLCG in 2012 was between 80,000 and 100,000 x86-64 cores.
In the future, other projects and researches will demand even more processing capacity from
the WLCG. For example, as stated by \cite{ACAT13ARM}, in order to upgrade the
luminosity of the LHC detectors to its full potential, the datasets will
increase size by two to three orders of magnitude, with processing power
increasing in proportion.

These outstanding numbers, in addition to the price of energy and the increasing
concerns with green computing, highlight the importance of
developing more efficient and methods and techniques high performance computing,
both in the scientific computing in general and in the LHC computing grid in
particular. 


\section{Tools and techniques for measuring energy consumption}
\subsection{Importance of measuring energy consumption}

% mining questions about software energy consumption
The study conducted by \cite{QUESTIONS_ENERGY}, shows that engineers have been
considering energy consumption as an important factor when developing software.
It consists on an empirical study that aims to understand the opinions and
problems of software developers about energy efficiency. The data that sustain
the conclusions are  mined from
a well-known technical forum (\textit{StackOverflow} \cite{STACKOVERFLOW}).
Although the study is focused in an application-level energy efficiency, it
shows that developers are aware of the importance of energy efficiency in 
computational systems. When trying to understand in depth what questions arise 
more frequently, it is shown that measurement techniques is amongst the most
asked questions by developers. In addition, the study ascertains that the 
\textit{"lack of tool support"} is an important handicap for the development of 
energy efficient software.



\section{ARM architecture}

\subsection{Literature review}

% initial explorations of ARM processors for scientific computing
\textbf{In \cite{ACAT13ARM}:}

- After 2015, processors have hit scaling limits. Two different paths started to be
taken on the processor industry:  development of multiprocessor architectures that
allow to run parallel tasks and the time clock frequency - which have been
increasing throughout the years - stabilized.

- Most High Physics Computing systems run in clusters of several cores.
Additional cores are parallelized and can run at the same time, which allows the
system to scale. However, also commodities such memory, I/O streams and energy
scale proportionally in such architectures.
 

% heterogeneous high throughput scientific computing with APM X-gene and Intel Xeon Phi
% TODO intel vs ARM pointers
% 
In \cite{ACAT14ARMDAVID}, a server-purpose ARM machine is compared with the recent
Intel architectures, such as the recent Intel Xeon Phi and a dominating Intel product
intended for HPC workloads (Intel Xeon E5-2650). The workload for comparing
the architectures was ParfullCMS. They based the results on performance (events per
second) and scalability over power (watts). In addition to performance and energy
consumption comparisons, the paper describes the porting endeavors of the CMSSW to
an ARMv8 64-bits architecture.


In \cite{ACAT14ARMDAVID}, they use an APM X-Gene 1 running on a development board. 
It consists of a 8 physical core processor running at 2.4GHz with 16GB DDR3 memory.
As the authors highlight, the firmware for managing processor ACPI power states was
not yet available when the study was made. Thus, it is expected that the energy 
performance will improve once the firmware is available \cite{ACAT14ARMDAVID}.

Under the circumstances of the experiment, the overall results show that APM X-Gene 
is 2.73 slower than Intel Xeon Phi. From the energy consumption performance (events
per second per watt), the Intel Xeon E-2650 is the most efficient, with APM X-Gene
presenting similar performances despite the absence of platform specific 
optimizations. Therefore, \cite{ACAT14ARMDAVID} concludes by stating that the APM
X-Gene 1 Server-On-Chip ARMv8 64-bit solution is relevant and potentially interesting
platform for heterogeneous high-density computing. 


\section{Workload scheduling based on dynamic energy pricing}

The workload scheduling based on dynamic energy pricing can be a good approach when certain conditions are in place. Firstly, in situations when the energy price changes according to the overall power grid energy usage. Secondly, when there are machines with different energy efficiency and computing performance available. Given these conditions, the main concept is to schedule the workload to more energy efficient machines when the energy price is higher. On the other hand, when the energy price is lower, the more performant machines can be used without huge degradation of the overal price budget.

There are several studies exploring inter data center solutions to lower
the electricity bill by leveraging the spacial-time dynamic of energy pricing. The 
emphasis is given to job scheduling across data centers that are located in 
different places. The main idea is to exploit the fact that energy prices 
are change based on location and time. The research community is mostly concerned 
with fairness, server availability, queue delays, bandwidth costs with job migration
and quality of service.. In addition there are several research studies related with 
migration of cloud computing jobs. Studies that in one way on another address this 
perspective are \cite{EFF_JOB_SCHEDULING}, \cite{MIGRATION_CLOUD}, 
\cite{MINIMIZING_DIST}, \cite{CUTTING_BILL}, \cite{SCHED_HETEROGE}, amongst others. 

Besides inter center solutions, the research community has been addressing the power 
consumption of the computing nodes specifically from a data center perspective.
This perspective is closer to what we are trying to achieve with our solution.
For example, one work that seems closer to our solution is \cite{DYN_PRICING_HPC}.
In this study, the authors achieve better energy performance in a dynamic
pricing environment with HPC systems by judiciously scheduling parallel jobs -
which have different energy profiles - depending on the energy pricing of the
moment. The main difference to out solution is that the performance of the machines 
are not taken into consideration when scheduling the jobs, but rather the job energy 
profiling.

Another research study that related to our solution is \cite{TASK_SCHED}. They
came up with an optimal algorithm and two heuristic algorithms to schedule tasks
to heterogeneous processors. In addition, they also take into consideration the 
memory allocation in heterogeneous memory in order
to minimize energy consumption while meeting the assumed deadlines. Their work,
though, seems to go further than our solution since it considers heterogeneous
memory allocation as well. They consider is a
computing process executing several tasks in a parallel computing environment. The
system consists in a variety of different computational node, each of one with a
given number of processors. All computational nodes are connected by a
high-speed network. Thus, all  the processors can cooperate and realize complementary
and parallel tasks. From the energy point of view, the processors of each 
computational node have an energy profile assigned and have a certain frequency, 
which will be taken into consideration when scheduling the task. The work dates 
from end of 2014, which indicates that this is a trendy and hot subject, but it 
seems that our approach is been used already. 

A similar idea has been explored in \cite{EXE_METHOD}. They present only
heuristic algorithms to schedule tasks on heterogeneous computing systems,
based on efficiency and energy consumption. They develop heuristic algorithms
due to the fact that an optimal solution for the needed scheduling is
NP-complete.  


According to \cite{EFF_JOB_SCHEDULING}, because of the magnitude of energy costs in data centers, it is important to
lower the energy consumption in data centers. The servers are composed of
heterogeneous machines from the performance and energy efficiency. In addition,
the data centers may be disposed in different geographical locations and, thus,
have different energy tariffs. The authors of \cite{EFF_JOB_SCHEDULING}, claim that
the key idea to lower the energy bill in data centers is to have energy
efficiency servers and schedule the jobs to where energy is more affordable at a
given time.

In the context of servers distributed over different geographical locations, it
is also important to satisfy fairness and delay constraints. This scenario is
less critical when the server is not distributed, as in our case.

In \cite{EFF_JOB_SCHEDULING}, the authors present an online scheduler that
distributes batch workloads across multiple data centers geographically
distributed. The scheduler aims to minimize the energy consumption of the set of
servers having into consideration fairness and delay requirements.   

The scheduler is inspired on the technique developed by Lyapunov ['Resource
allocation and cross-layer control in wireless networks'] that
optimized time-varying systems. 

The algorithm takes a queue of jobs schedule them to the different servers
having in consideration the (1) server availability, (2) energy price and (3)
job fairness distribution. Consequently, the algorithm is tuned to calculate the
tradeoff between energy pricing, fairness and queueing delay.

In \cite{EFF_JOB_SCHEDULING}, the scheduler developed takes into consideration
the server availability, energy costs, fairness and queuing delay to schedule
random jobs arrivals. It opportunistically schedules jobs when (and to where) 
energy prices are low.

Comparing to our study, though, we do not consider geographically distributed 
servers but rather, we have schedule the jobs based on the heterogeneous set of 
machines existing on the server.


The \cite{MIGRATION_CLOUD} study aims to exploit the temporal and geographical variation of
electricity prices, in the context of data centers. They study algorithms to
schedule (migrate) jobs in data center based on the energy cost and
availability.

When the servers are in different geographical location, costs with data
migration have to be taken into consideration, namely bandwidth costs of moving
the application state and data between data centers. The bandwidth costs
increase proportional to the amount of data migrated between servers.

Their study focuses on inter data center optimization, rather than intra data
center optimization (as our study is aiming for)

The algorithm differs from others in 3 major differences: First, they consider
migration of batches of jobs. Second, the algorithm has into consideration the
future influence of the job scheduling, providing robustness against any future
deviations of the energy price. Finally, they also take into consideration the 
bandwidth costs associated with job migration across data servers.

The main point is to provide a good tradeoff between the energy pricing and the
job migration, taking into consideration the bandwidth prices.

Comparing to our study, we do not approach the problem from an inter data center
perspective, but rather from an intra data center, by scheduling the jobs to
machines depending on their energy performance and the actual energy prices. One
interesting idea from this study that can be used, is the usage of an online
algorithm that takes into consideration the expected prices and also the actual
prices.


In \cite{MINIMIZING_DIST}, the researchers try to systematically study the problems of how
minimize the electricity cost in data centers while guaranteeing minimal quality
of service. To that end, they take into consideration the local and time diversity 
of electricity prices.

The contributions are twofold: In one hand, they show that local and time
dependent electricity pricing can be leveraged to minimize total energy price
of clusters of data centers. On the other hand, they present a mixed-integer
optimization formula with linear programming formulation to show that the energy
pricing of clustered data centers can be improved under such conditions.

To model the total of electricity costs, they assume that all the servers have a
similar power profile - which means that all the servers, disregarding their
locations, have the same workload. They calculate the power consumed by the
server by multiplying the total of servers at a certain region by the total of
workload they have. 

Again, the time constraints and delays considered in a inter data center study
does not need to be considered in out work.

They obtain the most efficient solution, they approximate an optimization
problem through a linear programming formulation and then, convert the linear
programming formulation to a minimum cost flow problem. 

This work dates from 2010 and don't take into consideration the bandwidth costs
of migrating the batches between data centers. Even though that is not an issue
in our study, this is taken into consideration in other works such as
\cite{MIGRATION_CLOUD}. Again, it is part of the set of studies on inter
datacenter and electrical costs optimizations that location and time based 
pricing allows.


The authors of \cite{CUTTING_BILL} show that existing systems may be able to
save millions of dollars by judiciously schedule workload to servers taking into
consideration the temporal and geographical variation of energy prices. The
results are based in historical data collected on Akamai's CDN. 

In \cite{DYN_PRICING_HPC}, the authors leverage the fact that parallel jobs have 
distinct energy profiles. Taking it into consideration, they study the impact of
scheduling jobs according to the energy prices at a given moment and the job's
energy profiles. So, the study aims to reduce the electricity bill by scheduling and
dispatching jobs according to their energy profile. Their solution has a
negligible impact on the system's utilization and scheduling fairness. 

Their basic idea is to schedule jobs with low energy profile during on-peak
electricity time and, on the other hand, schedule jobs with high energy profile
during the off-peak electricity time. In addition, the scheduling is done in
such a way that it is guaranteed that there is no degradation of the overall
system performance. 

The authors take an intra data center approach, since it considers a solution
that can be put into practice at a data center level.

The authors claim that "A key challenge in HPC scheduling is that system 
utilization should not be impacted. HPC systems require a tremendous capital 
investment, hence taking full advantage of this expensive resources is of great 
importance to HPC centers.". This may make impractical and wreck our solution,
because of the inevitability of turning off (or idle) great amounts of computing 
resources. Although, internet data centers (cloud data centers)  may be a good 
match to our solution: usually there are much less resources being used at a given 
time than in HTC computing [need confirmation, partially mentioned in this article].

The scheduling algorithm used places jobs in a time-window. The jobs are chosen
to run based on job fairness, job energy profile and energy prices at a given
time. A greedy algorithm and 0-1 Knapsack based policy are used to minimize the
electrical costs.

Their results show that gains in the order of 23\% can be obtained without
impact on the overall system. 

According to the survey carried by \cite{DYN_PRICING_HPC}, the dynamic energy
pricing has been implemented in the biggest markets in Europe, North America,
Oceania and China, while Japan was at the time starting to test it on its major
cities.

They develop two power aware job policies: 1) greedy approach, where jobs are
allocated based on their energy profiles  and 2) 0-1 Knapsack based policy,
where both job profile and system utilization are taking into consideration.



The authors of \cite{SCHED_HETEROGE} present a novel task scheduling algorithm
for HPC systems which considers two main points: reducing the energy consuption
of the overall system and minimize the schedule length. An HP system is defined
by the authors as set of distributed computing machines with differrent
configurations connected through a high speed link to compute paralell
applications.

They assume a that all the information needed to schedule the taksk is known
beforehand. The scheduling algorithm assigns then the jobs to the different
machines. Thus, the scheduling algorithm is said to be static, in opposition to,
for example, the online algorithms. 

One of the particularities of the algorithm is to reduce the impact of
duplication-based algorithms. The duplication-based algorithms schedule jobs
across machines redudantly, in order to maximize performance by eliminating
intercommunication between tasks. However, from the energy consumption point of
view, it is not th ideal situation since more than one processor are performing
the same job.

Once again, this research work aims at improve the energy efficiency of HPC
systems at a distributed level and do not focus, as our approach, on inter data
center solutions.

 
In \cite{TASK_SCHED}, the authors address the problem of an energy aware
scheduling for heteregenous data allocation and task scheduling. The problem
consists in finding the best taks scheduling in a heterogeneous system that meet
the deadlines while minimizing the energy consumption.

The processors and memories come in different flavors nowadays in HPC
systems, making complex the task of efficiently scheadule processor power and 
memory space in an energy efficient way. The problem of finding an optimal
processor and data scheduling becomes critical when trying to minimize energy 
consumption and meet imposed deadlines.

As the study shows, there are several research efforts tackling the task
scheduling problems on heterogenous computing and, most notably for our
research, \cite{EFF_DSP}.

They present an optimal algorithm and two heuristical algorithms to solve the
HDATS problem, since the optimal algorithm takes too long to solve problems
until 100 nodes. The optimal solution has two phases: First is uses the
DFG\_Assign\_CP algorithm to better map each task to node. Secondly, it choses the
data assignment to whose total energy consumed is reduced and the deadlines met.


The authors of \cite{EXE_METHOD} claim that, unfortunatelly, there are not many
studies of processor scheduling algorithms that take into consideration both
time and energy. In this study, they explore heuristical scheduling algorithms
focused on high performance computing and green computing. They work on
heuristical algorithms and not in the optimal algorithm, because the optimal
algorithm is proven to be NP-complete.
