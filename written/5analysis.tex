\chapter{Analysis}



The scope of the analysis presented in this section is twofold: to compare the
energy efficiency of the studied platforms and analyze the tools and techniques 
used on the different experiment sets. 
\\
Whereas the first two sections analyze the energy efficiency of the platforms
studied and the particularities of the tools and techniques used, the last section
covers the results and issues which arose when using RAPL to measure the energy 
consumption of a NUMA environment.

\section{First Set of Experiments}
ARM server vs ATOM and QUAD, using clap and software-based experiments

\subsection{Comparison ARM and Intel architecures}
\subsection{Tools and techniques}

\section{Second Set of Experiments}
ARM board and Intel Xeon, using on chip and external measurements

\subsection{Comparison ARM and Intel architecures}
\subsection{Tools and techniques}


\section{Third Set of Experiments}
Intel Xeon, using RAPL to measure energy consumed by the different nodes, with
different types of binding
