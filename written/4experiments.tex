\chapter{Experiments}


We performed experiments with different hardware setups. The experiments consisted on running simulations of HPC workload while measuring the energy consumed by CPU and by the whole machine.
The main goal is to compare the energy efficiency of ARM and Intel architectures. To attain that goal, we compared the results
of the experiments to evaluate the potential of ARM architectures to perform HPC tasks, in
comparison to the Intel architectures.

The software used to run the computing tasks
widely used in production and research at the CMS experiment. In order for the results to be as realistic as possible, we used data analysis software which are widely used in production at CERN.

We organized the experiments in 2 sets. The conditions under which the
experiments were conducted were similar. Due to hardware and software
limitations and availability, it was not possible to completely reproduce the experiment
conditions across all the sets. However, we believe that the differences will
affect the final results only to a reasonable degree, making it possible to scientifically compare the results. This and other considerations will be discussed further in the Analysis chapter. 

The tools and techniques used to perform the energy
consumption measurements were based on the study presented on the previous
chapter. The setups of the experiments, methodology and tools used to perform the energy
measurements during the experiments are explained and detailed in the following
sections.

Throughout this chapter, we will label \textit{set of experiments} as experiments conducted with
the same hardware and software configuration. The degrees of freedom of each
experiment are the number of events and number of threads processing the workload.
 
For each setup, we outline the hardware, software setups and the used energy measurement tools. 
During this chapter and throughout the rest of the thesis, we will describe
each batch of experiments as first set of experiments and second set of experiments.

The remainder of this chapter divided in three sections. Firstly, we discuss about the software used to perform the experiments. Secondly, we outline the most relevant characteristics of the
architectures used during the experiments. Lastly, we describe
the setup of the experiments and methodology used to perform the experiments. 

\section{Software}

In order to achieve result closest to reality, we ran our experiments in software which is widely used at CERN to analyze data from the CMS experiments. In order to analyze data from the CMS experiment, researchers use the CMS Software components (CMSSW) \cite{CMSSW_WORKBOOK}. The CMSSW is a collection of software available as a framework. It contains the software components necessary for physicists to perform data analysis. The main components are event data model and services needed by the simulation, calibration and alignment and event reconstruction modules. The CMS data event model uses an  \textit{Event} as an abstraction. An \textit{Event} is an object that contains all the raw and reconstructed data from a CMS collision. A collection on \textit{Events} are processed and analyzed by researchers to understand how the particles in the collision behaved.

In some of the setups used during our experiments, the CMSSW could not be used due to lack of hardware support. In those cases we relied on a Geatnt4 benchmark \cite{GEANT4} called ParFullCMS. ParFullCMS is a cross-platform test that simulates a subset of tasks carried by CMSSW. In addition, it is capable of running in multi-thread. ParFullCMS has been used in other research studies such as by Abdurachmanov, D. et all \cite{ACAT14ARMDAVID} to overcome similar the hardware support limitations as in our experiment setups.


\section{Hardware}
The focus of this work is to compare energy efficiency of ARM architectures and Intel based 
processors under similar workload. Our hardware choice  was conditioned to the
machine availability when the study was conducted. In addition, we also aimed
at comparing similar conditions and workloads across all the set of experiments. 

The ARM machines used were a single-board ARM processor developed by Odroid
\cite{ODROID_XU3} and a server class ARM processor by Boston 
Viridis \cite{VIRIDIS}. The Intel machines used were part of the micro-architectures family Sandy Bridge and Intel Bonnell. In the following sections, we will describe the hardware architecture, features of the hardware used to run the experiments.

\subsection{ARM architecture}
\subsubsection*{Boston Viridis server}

The Boston Viridis server is one of the first ARM architecture based servers
where the processors, IO and networking are fully integrated in one single chip.
According to the vendor, the server is intended to perform in a web server,
cloud and data analytics environment with outstanding power performance \cite{VIRIDIS}.

    \caption{A. Viridis Server chassis with 12 energy card in it. B. Energy card
with 4 nodes. Taken from \cite{VIRIDIS}}
    \label{fig:viridis&SoC}
\end{figure}


The Boston Viridis server used in this study (which we will label as ARM\_viridis throughout the rest of the document) consists of a chassis with twelve racks, each with an
energy card. Each energy card contains four nodes, as represented in Fig. \ref{fig:viridis&SoC}. 
A node is an ARM based CPU fabricated by Calxeda. The block diagram of a node is represented on Fig. \ref{fig:calxedaSOC}. 

Each ARM\_viridis node contains four ARM A9 Cortex core with a clock speed up
to 1.4MHz. A memory controller and L2 cache is included on the chip. In
addition, a couple of energy management blocks and IO controllers complete the
Calxeda EnergyCore processor \ref{fig:calxedaSOC}. These energy measurement
blocks were used to perform part of the energy measurements with this setup.


\begin{figure}[h!]

    \includegraphics[width=75mm]{"img/calxedaSOC"}
    \caption{Block diagram of Calxeda EnergyCore. Taken from \cite{VIRIDIS}}
    \label{fig:calxedaSOC}
\end{figure}


According to \cite{CORTEXA9}, the ARM A9 Cortex is a popular and mature general
purpose core for low-power devices. It was introduced in 2008 and it remains a
popular choice in smart-phones and applications enabling the Internet of Things
(IoT) \cite{CORTEXA9}. The ARM A9 Cortex supports the ARMv7A 
instruction set architecture. A detailed study of the ARMv7A internals is out
of scope of this work. More detailed specifications about the
internals of the ARMv7A instructions set can be found in \cite{CORTEXA9}.


\subsubsection*{ODROID-XU3 development board}

The ODROID-XU3 \cite{ODROID_XU3} is an open-source development board produced by
 Hardkernel. They claim that the ODROID-XU3 is a "new generation of computing device
with more powerful, more energy efficient hardware and smaller form factor"
\cite{ODROID_XU3}. At the time of these experiments, the ODROID-XU3 was  mostly used for testing and platform development and it was not intended to run in production scenarios. Throughout this document, the ODROID-XU3 described in this section will be called ARM\_odroid.

The ODROID-XU3 processor has four Samsung Exynos-5422 Cortex A15 and four Cortex A7 cores,
with 2GB of LPDDR2 RAM. Only four cores are working at the same time and they are 
scheduled based on the big.LITTLE technology. The big.LITTLE technology
\cite{biglittle} automatically schedules workloads across cores based on
performance and energy needs. The vendor claims that the big.LITTLE technology
can achieve energy savings from 40\% to 
75\%, depending on the performance scenario \cite{biglittle}.
It is important to note that, even though the CPU contains eight cores, only four of then are working at a
given moment. The block diagram of the ODROID-XU3 can be seen in 
\ref{fig:odroidxu3-diagram}.


The ODROID-XU3 has a Texas Instrument power monitor chip (TI INA231) embedded
from origin. The TI INA231 provides an API to read the energy consumed by the 
cores and DRAM at a sampling rate of microseconds. These readings can be easily triggered and read
through software and consist of an accurate way to make fine-grained energy
consumption measurements. We assumed that the measurements made by the TI INA231 can 
be compared to the RAPL technology by Intel.

    \caption{ODROID-XU3 block diagram. Taken from \cite{ODROID_XU3}}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Intel x86 architecture}

We used three different machines running CPUs from the x86 Intel instruction family. The Intel x86 machines are the most widely
used solutions for server and workstation applications nowadays. According to Gartne \cite{INTEL_DOMINANCE}, Intel market share accounts for 92\% of worldwide sold server processors in 2013. Following the trend, the majority of computing nodes at CERN Intel x86 CPUs.


The Intel Xeon used in the experiments had RAPL enabled (refer to Chapter 3), which allowed us to measure energy
consumption accurately at a fine-grained level. Since the Intel Atom and Intel Quad machines
did not have RAPL technology enabled, we used a clamp power meter to measure the
energy consumed by the CPU at a given time during our experiments.

The different types of measurements within the same architecture and
its possible affect on he final result are discussed in the Analysis section.

\subsubsection*{Intel Xeon}

The Intel Xeon family \cite{xeon_intro}, is an Intel x86 microprocessor release that is targeted to non-consumer workstation. The main target of this family of processors are data centers, servers and embedded devices. Based on Intel's official web page \cite{xeon_intro}, Xeon family of processors offers a range of solutions for real time analytic services. Among those capabilities, Intel Xeon features an implementation of RAPL, which is a mechanism that provides feedback on the performance impact of power limiting.

\subsubsection*{Intel Quad}

The Intel Quad Core 2 family \cite{quad_specs} is a consumer targeted 64-bit x86 four core microprocessors CPU. The first Intel Quad core 2 qas released in 2006 and according to official sources this family of processors is in end of life status and seen as legacy technology. This family of CPUs has thermal monitoring techniques but does not include the RAPL component as the more recent Intel products. 


\subsubsection*{Intel Atom}

Intel Atom \cite{atom_page} is the family of Intel CPUs targeted at low power consuming devices, such as laptops, smart phones and embedded devices. Its ultra-low-voltage 32 bits architecture was design for energy efficiency and low power consumption. As in Intel Xeon, RAPL was not included in this family of CPUs.

The chips that are part of the Intel Atom family are the ones closer to the ARM chipset in terms of design, purpose and power consumption.

\section{Experiments setup}
\subsection{First set of experiments}

\subsubsection*{Hardware specifications}
For the first set of experiments, we used three machines with different hardware setups. The three machines differ in architecture and purpose. We ran the same workloads in a x86 Intel Atom and Intel Quad for comparison.

Below, we outline the most important specifications of the hardware setups we used for the experiments.

\end{itemize}

For more detailed specs refer to the official ARM Viridis specs \cite{viridis_specs}.


\subsubsection*{Software and workload}
We used the CMSSW framework in the generation-simulation mode (GEN\-SIM). The work-flow performs a Monte Carlo simulation of 8 TeV LHC Minimum bias event using Pynthia8 (generation step), followed by Simulation with Geant4 (simulation step).
At the time of the experiments, the CMSSW port for ARM had limitations on the multi-threading support. We wanted to study the energy consumption of each hardware setup given different core load. Thus, we spin up different processes instead of threads. The core-load levels used were 1/4, 1/2, 1 and 2 processes per number of physical cores. 

\subsubsection*{Metrics}
The energy efficiency metric used in this study is the ratio of performance per power consumed (in watts). Performance consist on the average of events computed per second. Considering this metrics for comparing energy consumption, we consider a system to be as energy efficient as higher the ratio \textit{nr\_of\_events/s/W} is.

Given the hardware disparities of the setups we had in place to run our experiments, we used the performance (average events computed per second) as a way to uniform the results.

\subsubsection*{Tools for measuring energy consumption}
For this set of experiments, we performed physical measurements using an external clamp meter. The clamp was a Mini AC/DC Clamp meter
Mastech MS2102 AC/DC (see Figure \ref{fig:clamp}). The clamp meter supports a maximum of 200A current, which was enough for our experiments. In addition, it presents an accuracy of +-2.5\%.

\subsection{Second set of experiments}

\subsubsection*{Hardware specifications}

For the second set of experiments, we again used three machines with different hardware setups. As in the first set of experiments, the three machines differ in architecture and purpose. The ARM Virdis - which was used in the first set of experiments - was also used during the second set of experiments. In addition, we also used another machine powered by an ARM CPU. The ARM Odroid is a development board manufactured by HardKernel \cite{ODROID_XU3}. ARM Odroid provides a cheap and easy way to develop hardware and software on top of an ARM architecture. As for the Intel architectures, we used Intel Xeon, a machine from the Intel Sandy Bridge family and powered by an Intel R5-2650 CPU. This machine was part of a server rack and it was intended for high performance scientific computation in a production scenario.

Below, we outline the most important aspects of the hardware setups we used for the experiments.

  \item[] \textbf{Memory}:        252GB
\end{itemize}

For more detailed specs refer to the official Intel Xeon specs \cite{xeon_specs}.


\subsubsection*{Software and workload}
We used the ParCullCMS mode of CMSSW for generating the workload. The ParFullCMS mode is a multi-threaded Geant4 \cite{GEANT4} benchmark. It uses a complex CMS geometry for the event simulation and has the advantage of being multi-threaded in both Intel and ARM architectures. As in the first set of experiments, we measured the energy consumed by the machine under different physical core loads. The core-load levels used were 1/4, 1/2, 1 and 2 threads per number of physical cores. 

\subsubsection*{Metrics}
As in the first set of experiments, the energy efficiency metric used in this study is the ratio of performance per power consumed \textit{nr\_of\_events/s/W}. The hardware setups used in the second set of experiments differ in specs and features. Therefore, we used the this metric as a way to uniform the results.

\subsubsection*{Tools for measuring energy consumption}
For the second set of experiments, we performed both internal and external measurements in the Intel Xeon and ARM Odroid. On the ARM Viridis, we performed only internal measurements given the lack of a tool that would perform with the same degree of accuracy than the tools used for Intel Xeon and ARM Odroid. All the tools used to measure energy consumption were embedded in the hardware setup of the machines.

For the ARM Odroid, we used a Texas Instrument power monitor chip (TI INA231) for internal measurements. The TI INA231 allowed us to sample the energy consumed by the cores and DRAM at a frequency rate of microseconds. For the external measurements on the ARM Odroid, we used an external plug-in power monitor with a computer interface for sampling and storing the results.

For the Intel Xeon machine, we used the Running Average Power Unit (RAPL) technology to perform internal measurements. The RAPL allowed us to sample the energy consumed by the CPU's package, DRAM and cores. For the external measurements, we used an API provided by the server rack's PDU. This API provides a measure sampling rate of around 1 second. 

For the ARM Viridis, we used the capabilities of the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) \cite{IPMI} included in the server from origin. The IPMI is a chip that runs as a separate subsystem and is attached to the motherboard. The ARM Viridis implementation of IPMI provide several capabilities, namely internal hardware energy monitoring. We leveraged the IPMI tools to perform internal energy consumption of the ARM cores during the experiments

\section{Summary}

We have performed several experiments under different hardware setups. 
Our main goal was to understand how the ARM and Intel architectures
perform under similar workloads from an energy consumption standpoint.

In this chapter we outlined the setup of the machines used during the experiments.

The hardware setups were chosen given their similarity and possibility of a reliable comparison and hardware availability. It is important to note that both ARM Viridis and ARM Odroid machines are much more recent than the compared Intel
hardware. All the ARM machines used were still a technology that was yet to find production
stability at the moment of the experiments. On the other hand, the Intel architecture used in this study was widely used in real HPC applications at the time of this study.

For this study, we assume that the RAPL, the internal TI INA231 chip and the IPMI tools for internal energy
consumption measurement are similarly accurate and would produce the same results if interchanged.
